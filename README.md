## Description

### Overview

This tutorial shows how to use the Industrial Edge applications SLMP Configurator and SLMP Connector to establish a connection to a Mitsubishi PLC. These PLC variants are supported:

* Mitsubishi iQR series
* Mitsubishi iQF series

With the connection between an Industrial Edge Device (SLMP client) and a Mitsubishi PLC (SLMP server) data can be transfered. On the Industrial Edge Device (IED), the data is published to the Databus. From there the data can be used within other Edge apps.

### General Task

Here we configure a connection to a Mitsubishi PLC FX5U (iQF), that supports the SLMP protocol. The FX5U acts as SLMP server and the IED acts as SLMP client. Data is read from the FX5U and published on the Databus. By using the application IE Flow Creator, the received data on the dedicated topic can be print out.

## Installation

How to install/run this application example? (i.e. how to deploy it to Industrial Edge device?) How to build this application? How to set up configurations in IE?

To keep the readme.md file as short as possible please add more detailed information in the docs folder.

* [Build application](docs/Installation.md#build-application)

## Usage

When the app is installed, how can I use it? Usually some basic UI description to prove that the app is working correctly.

## Documentation

Add links to documentation. Either on external URL or in the doc folder. Please use always link to a file not to a directory (it doesn't work with static site generator engines).
