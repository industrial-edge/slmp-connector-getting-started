## Description

### Overview

This tutorial shows how to use the Industrial Edge applications SLMP Configurator and SLMP Connector to establish a connection to a Mitsubishi PLC. These PLC variants are supported:

* Mitsubishi iQR series
* Mitsubishi iQF series

With the connection between an Industrial Edge Device (SLMP client) and a Mitsubishi PLC (SLMP server) data can be transfered. On the Industrial Edge Device (IED), the data is published to the Databus. From there the data can be used within other Edge apps.

### General Task

Here we configure a connection to a Mitsubishi PLC FX5U (iQF), that supports the SLMP protocol. The FX5U acts as SLMP server and the IED acts as SLMP client. Data is read from the FX5U and published on the Databus. By using the application IE Flow Creator, the received data on the dedicated topic can be print out.

## Installation

You can find the further information about the following steps in the [Installation](/docs/Installation.md) documentation:

* [Configure IE Databus](/docs/Installation.md#configure-ie-databus)
* [Install SLMP Configurator and Connector](/docs/Installation.md#install-slmp-configurator-and-connector)
* [Configure SLMP Connector](/docs/Installation.md#configure-slmp-connector)

## Usage

As soon as the SLMP Connector is configured to connect to the Mitsubishi PLC, data can be transfered.
