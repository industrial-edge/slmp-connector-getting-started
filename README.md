## Description

### Overview

This tutorial shows how to use the Industrial Edge application SLMP Connector to establish a connection between an Industrial Edge Device (IED) and a 3rd party PLC that supports SLMP (Seamless Messaging Protocol), which is a client/server protocol for point to point communication between standard TCP/IP Ethernet devices and CC-Link IE networks.

These PLC variants are supported:

* Mitsubishi iQR series
* Mitsubishi iQF series

The SLMP Connector is an application that runs on the individual IED. Connections can be configured using the Common Configurator for Industrial Edge. The connector transfers the value series of selected data points from a PLC to the Databus. From there the data can be used within other Edge apps, e.g. the Flow Creator.

### General Task

Here we configure a connection to a Mitsubishi PLC FX5U (iQF) using the SLMP Connector. The FX5U acts as SLMP server and the IED acts as SLMP client. The data is published on the IE Databus. By using the application IE Flow Creator, we fetch the metadata of the SLMP Connector, write some data on the configured tags and read out the new data.

## Configuration

You can find further information about the following steps in the [Configuration](/docs/Installation.md) documentation:

- [Overview](/docs/Installation.md#overview)
- [Install SLMP Connector](/docs/Installation.md#install-slmp-connector)
- [Configure IE Databus](/docs/Installation.md#configure-ie-databus)
- [Configure SLMP via IIH Configurator](/docs/Installation.md#configure-slmp-via-iih-configurator)

## Usage

As soon as the SLMP Connector is configured, data can be transfered.

You can find further information about how to handle the data via the IE Flow Creator in the [Usage](/docs/Usage.md) documentation:

* [Read metadata](/docs/Usage.md#read-metadata)
* [Write data](/docs/Usage.md#write-data)
* [Read data](/docs/Usage.md#read-data)
